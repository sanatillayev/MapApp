# MapApp

Welcome to the SwiftUI MapApp project! This repository contains the source code for a beginner-level app developed after completing the SwiftUI Bootcamp. The focus of this project is to better understand MVVM architecture and to get more comfortable using SwiftUI frames, alignments, animations, and transitions.

## Overview

In this app, we'll import real-world locations such as the Colosseum and the Eiffel Tower and display them on the map with a visually appealing UI. The project leverages the native SwiftUI Map from MapKit for seamless integration and a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture:** The project follows the MVVM architecture, allowing for a clear separation of concerns. The Model handles data layer logic, the View manages the user interface, and the ViewModel contains the business logic, connecting the View to the underlying data models.
- **SwiftUI Mastery:** Explore SwiftUI frames, alignments, animations, and transitions while building a beautiful and interactive user interface.
- **Native Map Integration:** Utilize the power of the native SwiftUI Map from MapKit to seamlessly display real-world locations.

## Learning Objectives

*By exploring this MapApp project, you will:*

Gain a deeper understanding of MVVM architecture in SwiftUI.
Enhance your skills in using frames, alignments, animations, and transitions.
Learn to integrate and work with the native SwiftUI Map from MapKit.
